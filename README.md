# Description. A brief description of what the project is about
- This is a classic coding challenge often used to assess /imgprogramming and code refactoring skills. The challenge is based on a fictional inventory system of a shop called Gilded Rose, where each item in the inventory has a quality and an expiration date. The task is to refactor and improve the existing code that updates the quality of items as time passes.


## How to Install and Run the Project.
- Clone the repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:BrightCoders-Institute/s3a2-la-rosa-dorada-team4_s3a2_rosa_dorada.git
```

## How to Use the Project.
- Run the project
```bash
cd s3a2-la-rosa-dorada-team4_s3a2_rosa_dorada
ruby lib/texttest_fixture.rb 10
```
Note: The number 10 is the number of days you want to run the program.
